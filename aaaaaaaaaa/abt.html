         <h1> IVONNE HIGUERO </h1>
         <h2> SECRETARY-GENERAL CITES SECRETARIAT </h2>
         <p>We are extremely fortunate to count on the presence of an endless diversity of wild animals, plants, and
            other lifeforms that together make up life on our planet. </p>

         <p>Humans around the world benefit every single day from wildlife. In many ways, our history is the story of
            our species’ interaction with, and adaptation to, the diverse lifeforms present in our close vicinity. Since
            time immemorial, we have used wild plants and animals for out most basic needs: from the air we breathe, to
            the food we eat, to the materials we use for shelter and comfort.</p>

         <p>The human well-being and prosperity that is derived from the direct exploitation of wildlife, habitats and
            ecosystems should not be to the detriment of the building blocks of a rich and diverse biosphere. The
            Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES) was agreed in 1973 to
            avoid this by regulating international trade in wildlife and ensure that this trade is legal, sustainable
            and traceable.</p>

         <p>More and more, however, the unsustainable exploitation of wild fauna and flora and their ecosystems is
            threatening their survival. Every single piece of the puzzle of life is essential and losing even the
            smallest of these pieces leaves us, and the entire planet, poorer. When human actions endanger hundreds of
            thousands of species, as they are doing today, it is the entire biosphere - of which we too are a part -
            that is threatened.</p>

         <p>We now face the immense challenge of living in harmony with nature so that we can fulfill our own needs
            without neglecting those of the many lifeforms with which we share this planet on sea, land and air.</p>

         <p>The inclusion of endangered species in the CITES Appendices, the conservation efforts undertaken by our
            Parties, and the added endeavors of partners in other Conventions or organizations working on biodiversity
            and development helps to counteract the loss of biodiversity on the planet.</p>

         <p>However, transformative changes are needed as we find ourselves at a critical turning point both for our
            species and for the entire biosphere. Now more than ever we must come together in a joint effort to sustain
            all life on Earth.</p>

         <h1> ANTÓNIO GUTERRES </h1>
         <h2> SECRETARY-GENERAL UNITED NATIONS </h2>
         <p>Humanity is an inextricable part of the rich tapestry of life that makes up our world’s biological
            diversity. All human civilizations have been and continue to be built on the use of wild and cultivated
            species of flora and fauna, from the food we eat to the air we breathe.</p>

         <p>However, it seems that humanity has forgotten just how much we need nature for our survival and well-being.
            As our population and our needs continue to grow, we keep exploiting natural resources - including wild
            plants and animals and their habitats - in an unsustainable manner.</p>

         <p>In its 2019 Global Assessment, the Intergovernmental Panel for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)
            highlighted how the current global rate of species extinction is rampant and accelerating - tens to hundreds
            of times higher than before humans inhabited the planet. </p>

         <p>By overexploiting wildlife, habitats and ecosystems, humanity is endangering both itself and the survival of
            countless species of wild plants and animals. Today, close to a quarter of all species on the planet are in
            danger of becoming extinct in the next decades.</p>

         <p>On this World Wildlife Day, let us remind ourselves of our duty to preserve and sustainably use the vast
            variety of life on the planet. Let us push for a more caring, thoughtful and sustainable relationship with
            nature. A world of thriving biodiversity provides the foundation we need to achieve our Sustainable
            Development Goals of a world of dignity and opportunity for all people on a healthy planet.</p>

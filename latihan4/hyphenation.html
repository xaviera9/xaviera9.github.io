               <h1 class="judul">Hyphenation</h1>
               <h2 class="judul">Mandatory for justified text; <br>optional otherwise</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="mainc1">
               <p>Hyphenation is the automated process of breaking words between lines to create more consistency across
                  a text block.
                  In justified text, hyphenation is mandatory.
                  In left-aligned text, hyphenation evens the irregular right edge of the text, called the rag.
                  Hyphenation is optional for left-aligned text because the rag will still be somewhat irregular, even
                  with hyphenation. Hyphenation doesn’t improve text legibility. In this case, consider turning it off.
               </p>

               <p>As line length gets shorter, hyphenation becomes essential. Why? With hyphenation off, your word
                  processor or web browser can only break lines at word spaces. As the lines get shorter, there are
                  fewer words and hence fewer possible break points in each line, making awkward breaks more likely.
                  In word processors, you can exert rudimentary control over automatic hyphenation. If you’re curious,
                  search your help file for “hyphenation options.” Over the years, I’ve never touched these, so I doubt
                  you’ll need to either. The nonbreaking hyphen and the optional hyphen solve most hyphenation problems,
                  and even those are pretty rare.</p>

               <p>In pro page-layout programs, you can exert a lot of control over automatic hyphenation (usually in
                  conjunction with justification, so all the settings together are known as H&Js).
                  In web browsers, you can exert almost no control over automatic hyphenation, so if you use CSS
                  hyphenation, be prepared for some clunkers.</p>
               <p>If you’re using a web content-management system like WordPress, an alternative hyphenation method is
                  to use a plugin that puts soft hyphens (aka optional hyphens) in the text. Soft hyphens are well
                  supported in web browsers, even browsers that don’t support CSS hyphenation (e.g., desktop Chrome).
                  This also allows somewhat more control over hyphenation. But it’s more work. If your project demands
                  full justification, this might be worth it. Otherwise, probably not.</p>

               <p>Hyphens and dashes look similar, but they’re not interchangeable.</p>

                  <h3>The hyphen (-) is the smallest of these marks. It has three uses<h3>
               </div>

               <div class="nlist">
                  <ol>
                     <li>A hyphen appears at the end of a line when a word breaks onto the next line. These hyphens are
                        added and removed automatically by the automatic hyphenation in your word processor or web
                        browser.</li>
                     <li>Some multipart words are spelled with a hyphen (topsy-turvy, cost-effective, bric-a-brac). But
                        a prefix is not typically followed with a hyphen (nonprofit, not non-profit).</li>
                     <li>A hyphen is used in phrasal adjectives (listener-supported radio, dog-and-pony show,
                        high-school grades) to ensure clarity. Nonprofessional writers often omit these hyphens. As a
                        professional writer, you should not. For instance, consider the unhyphenated phrase five dollar
                        bills. Is five the quantity of dollar bills, or are the bills each worth five dollars? As
                        written, it suggests the former. If you mean the latter, then you’d write five-dollar bills.
                     </li>
                  </ol>
               </div>

               <div class="note">[Note: No hyphen is necessary in phrasal adjectives that begin with an adverb
                  ending in ‑ly (it’s a closely held company, not a closely-held company). Nor is a hyphen necessary in
                  multipart foreign terms or proper names used as adjectives (habeas corpus appeal on the Third Circuit
                  docket, not habeas-corpus appeal on the Third-Circuit docket).]

               <div class="mainc">
                  <p class="p-special">Dashes come in two sizes—the en dash and the em dash. The em dash (—) is
                     typically about as wide as
                     a capital H. The en dash (–) is about half as wide.</p>
                  <p class="p-special">En and em dashes are often approximated by typing two or three hyphens in a row
                     (-- or --- ). Don’t
                     do that—it’s another typewriter habit. Use real dashes.</p>
               </div>

               <div class="mainc2">
                  <h3>The en dash has two uses.</h3>

                  <ol>
                     <li>It indicates a range of values (1880–1912, pages 330–39, Exhibits A–E). If you open with from,
                        pair it with to instead of an en dash (from 1880 to 1912, not from 1880–1912).</li>
                     <li>t denotes a connection or contrast between pairs of words (conservative–liberal split,
                        Arizona–Nevada reciprocity, Sarbanes–Oxley Act).</li>
                  </ol>
               </div>

               <div class="mainc2">
                  <p class="p-special">The em dash is used to make a break between parts of a sentence. Use it when a
                     comma is too weak,
                     but a colon, semicolon, or pair of parentheses is too strong. The em dash puts a nice pause in the
                     text—and it is underused in professional writing.</p>
               </div>

               <div class="mainc2">
                  <h3>[End note] By The Way</h3>
               </div>
               <div class="enote">
                  <ul>
                     <li>Don’t use a slash ( / ) where an en dash is correct.</li>
                     <li>Even though the en dash is used for joint authors (Sarbanes–Oxley Act), use a hyphen for
                        compound names. If the son and daughter of Sarbanes and Oxley married, they’d be known as Mr. &
                        Mrs. Sarbanes-Oxley (with a hyphen), not Mr. & Mrs. Sarbanes–Oxley (with an en dash).-</li>
                     <li>Em and en dashes are typically set flush against the surrounding text. Some fonts include a
                        little white space around the em dash; some don’t. If your em dashes look like they’re being
                        crushed—particularly if you’re setting type on screen—it’s fine to add word spaces before and
                        after.</li>
                     <li>An en dash makes an acceptable minus sign in spreadsheets or mathematical expressions.</li>
                     <li>Em and en refer to units of typographic measurement, not to the letters M and N. (Yes, the
                        homophony is confusing. To disambiguate, loud print shops referred to them as mutton and nut.)
                        In a traditional metal font, the em was the vertical distance from the top of a piece of type to
                        the bottom. The en was half the size of the em. Originally, the width of the em and en dashes
                        corresponded to these units. In today’s digital fonts, they run narrower.</li>
                     <li>Fans of Robert Bringhurst’s book The Elements of Typographic Style (and I am among them—see
                        bibliography) may know that he recommends using en dashes with spaces rather than em dashes.
                        Perhaps this practice is common in Mr. Bringhurst’s native Canada. But in American typography,
                        it’s not.</li>

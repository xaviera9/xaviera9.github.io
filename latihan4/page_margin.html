               <h1>Page Margin</h1>
               <h2>One inch is not enough</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="sub">
               Page margins set the default territory your text occupies on the page. Because they
               determine
               the maximum width of the text block, page margins have the greatest effect on line length. (Point size
               also
               affects line length, though more finely.) As page margins increase, line length decreases, and vice
               versa.
            </div>

            <div class="note">
               [Note: A gutter margin is extra space on the inner edge of a page, used to account for a binding. In a
               duplex (two-sided) document, the gutter margin will automatically alternate sides. ]
            </div>

            <div class="mainc">
               <h3>In Print</h3>
               <p>Most word processors default to page margins of one inch. On standard 8.5" x 11" paper, that
                  produces
                  a
                  line length of 6.5". That was fine for the monospaced fonts of the typewriter era, which used a lot
                  of
                  horizontal space. But for proportional fonts, they're too small.
               </p>

               <p>At 12 point, left and right page margins of 1.5-2.0" will usually give you a comfortable line
                  length.
                  But
                  don't take that range as an absolute-focus on getting the number of characters per line into the
                  right
                  range (see line length). The smaller the point size, the larger the page margins will need to be,
                  and
                  vice versa. </p>

               <h3>On The Web</h3>
               <p>Originally, web browsers had no concept of margins-text simply flowed from one edge of the window
                  to
                  the
                  other. That wasn't a huge problem at the time, because computer screens were much smaller. With the
                  advent of CSS, web designers could use the margin and padding properties to create space between
                  text
                  and
                  the edge of its containing block.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, the web has never shaken the edge-to-edge design idiom. Many of today's websites
                  still
                  look
                  like they were created by designers who got paid by the square inch. Just as it's important in
                  print
                  to
                  let go of typewriter habits, it's important on the web to let go of the habits.</p>
               <p>To preserve text legibility, web pages need big margins too. There isn't one margin size that will
                  work
                  for all web pages, but the core advice is the same as on the printed page-focus on line length. As
                  you
                  do
                  that, you'll find your margins getting bigger. Don't panic. </p>

               <h3>Fear Of White Space </h3>
               <p><i>“But if I use bigger margins, won’t a lot of the page be empty?” </i><strong>Sure. Is that a
                     problem?</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="note-special">[Note: In 1921, the U.S. government introduced both 8.5″ × 11″ and 8″ ×
               10.5″ as standard paper sizes. The smaller size caught on within U.S. government agencies; the larger,
               with everyone else. It wasn’t until 1980 that the whole U.S. government finally settled on 8.5″ × 11″. ]
            </div>

            <div class="mainc">
               <p>The 8.5″ × 11″ paper size, and the sizes of computer screens, are standards imposed on us by history
                  and tradition. They are arbitrary. They do not represent anyone’s idea of a convenient size for good
                  typography. But with page margins, you can reshape them. As proof, consider a print example. Are there
                  any publications that use 8.5″ × 11″ paper? Yes, it’s the approximate size of many magazines. But do
                  any of those magazines run text in a single block on the page with one-inch margins? No—never. They
                  use multiple-column layouts or find other ways to divide the page.
               </p>
               <p>So, are there any publications that do run text in a single block on the page? Sure—books are usually
                  set in a single column. But do you ever see a book printed on 8.5″ × 11″ paper? No—never. It would be
                  too big for comfortable reading.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Professional typographers never use 8.5″ × 11″ paper with a 6.5″ line length. Neither should you.
                  Whether you’re writing for print or the web, set your text according to the principles of good
                  typography. The white space will take care of itself. The pleasure of reading an effectively designed
                  document will soon outweigh the unfamiliarity of extra white space around the edges.

               <p><i>“But with those big margins, I won’t get nearly as many words on the page.” <i> <strong>Oh
                           really?<strong> Let’s address that fear with a word-processor exercise that brings together
                              some of what you’ve learned so far.</p>

                     peculiar math, I agree.
                     See line spacing.) I’m
                     using it here because it’s the line-spacing option many people select
                     by default. </li>
                  <li>Start another new document in your word processor. Paste in the same text. </li>
                  <li>Format this second document as follows: page margins of 2″ per side, font is still Times New
                     Roman, point size is, line spacing is exactly 15 points, first-line indent is still 0.5″, and still
                     no space between paragraphs. I’ll call this document B. </li>
                  <li>Print both documents. Which one looks more like a professionally typeset book: A or B?</li>
               </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="note"><br>(sidenote. Shortcut: the “before” and “after” samples in research papers are pretty
               close to the formatting of documents A and B.) </div>

               <ol class="split" start="6">
                  <li>Which document is more comfortable to read: A or B?</li>
                  <li>Which document contains more words per page: A or B? (Hint: use word count. See line length for
                     instructions.) </li>

               <p> I’m guessing you answered B to the last three questions. If so, you’re seeing how good typography can
                  be a benevolent force—it improves the appearance and legibility of your text with no compromise in
                  words per page. </p>

               <h3>[End Note] By The Way </h3>
            </div>

            <div class="enote">
               <ul>
                  <li>A gutter margin is extra space on one side of a printed page that accounts for a binding. In a
                     duplex (two-sided) document, the gutter will automatically alternate sides.
                  </li>
                  <li>In a printed document, do your margins all have to be the same size? No. To fit more text on the
                     page, reduce the top and bottom margins. Your line length will stay the same, but you’ll get more
                     lines per page. To make the text block appear centered vertically, try making the bottom margin
                     about a 0.25″ larger than the top margin. Otherwise, the text block can look like it’s sagging.
                     Finally, there’s no rule that a text block has to be centered on the page horizontally. For an
                     asymmetric layout, make the difference between the left and right margins at least 1″ to make the
                     asymmetry obvious. </li>
                  <li>The best way to judge a layout is with your eyes, not with a calculator. But typographers have
                     long enjoyed fiddling with layouts that incorporate specific mathematical ratios. Most famous among
                     these is the golden ratio, which is approximately 1.618: 1. For instance, if you set page margins
                     of 2.23″ on all four sides of 8.5″ × 11″ paper, the proportions of your text block will be close to
                     the golden ratio.</li>
